## CPNT 270 - Prototypes A5

My design was made the way it is because I wanted a simplistic looking site/design. I didn't use many colours as I didn't want the users to be distracted from the main purpose of the website.

Some troubleshooting issues I had were:

- Figuring out where to connect the prototype connector to
- Where to start the connectors
